I am currently using Jenkins in my project. And during the development 
of this project, I developed a new plug-in, which is modified from an 
existing plug-in: 
https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Extended+Choice+Parameter... 

But my plug-in is to get data from database and use them as choices. 
Here is how the plug-in looks like:

Properties File is a file that contains the properties of a database 
and the sql to get the result. It should have the format of the 
following content: 
host=localhost 
user=root 
passwd=root 
db=test 
query=select name from product 
port=3306 

Then it would look this in job page: 
http://jenkins.361315.n4.nabble.com/file/n4413231/project.jpg 
At present, I only tested it with MySQL. But I am willing to add 
support to other DB if needed. I want to call this plugin "get 
parameters from database " for now.
